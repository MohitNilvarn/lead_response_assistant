    {
      "topic": "Damp Patches on Walls",
      "content": "Damp patches on walls, especially after rains, are usually caused by water seepage through external walls, failed waterproofing, cracks in the building envelope, or poor drainage. This requires professional inspection to identify the exact source of moisture ingress. UrbanRoof uses thermal scanning to precisely locate the seepage path without any demolition."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Roof Leakage During Monsoon",
      "content": "Roof leakage during monsoon or heavy rains indicates deteriorated waterproofing membrane, cracks in the roof slab, or improper slope causing water pooling. A professional thermal scan inspection can identify the exact leak points. The repair approach depends on the specific issue found during inspection."

    {
      "topic": "Bathroom Leakage and Seepage",
      "content": "Bathroom leakage and seepage can occur due to failed waterproofing around fixtures, cracked tiles, deteriorated grouting, or pipe leaks. These issues can affect adjacent rooms and floors below. Thermal scanning helps identify the exact source without breaking tiles unnecessarily."

    {
      "topic": "Basement Water Seepage",
      "content": "Basement water seepage is often caused by hydrostatic pressure from groundwater, cracks in basement walls, or poor external waterproofing. This is a serious structural concern that requires professional assessment and targeted waterproofing solutions."

      "topic": "Paint Peeling and Efflorescence",
      "content": "Paint peeling, bubbling, or white salt deposits (efflorescence) on walls are symptoms of underlying moisture problems. Simply repainting will not solve the issue. The root cause of moisture ingress must be identified and addressed through professional inspection and appropriate waterproofing."

    {
      "topic": "Cracks in Walls and Ceiling",
      "content": "Cracks in walls and ceilings can be cosmetic (surface-level) or structural. Some cracks allow water ingress which worsens over time. Professional assessment is needed to determine the type and severity of cracks and recommend appropriate repair methods."

    {
      "topic": "Terrace Waterproofing Failure",
      "content": "Terrace waterproofing can fail due to weathering, UV degradation, thermal expansion, or poor original application. Signs include water stains on the ceiling below, dampness, and paint peeling. Re-waterproofing requires proper surface preparation and application of appropriate waterproofing systems."
